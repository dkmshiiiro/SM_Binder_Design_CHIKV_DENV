PATCHDOCK

- It is probably better to use a local version of PatchDock since for each backbone a PatchDock run must be conducted. 
- A script name "patchdock_run.sh" for automating this process is available. You need the local version of PatchDock installed and the PatchDock executables accessible in your system path.
- "PATCHDOCK_RES" is where you defined your target residues (which as explained in the main text, should be located in a high SAP area)


RIFDOCK

- To use rifdock you need to install a 3.9 version of Rosetta

- Expect to use lots of RAM, 16 GB is often not enough.
