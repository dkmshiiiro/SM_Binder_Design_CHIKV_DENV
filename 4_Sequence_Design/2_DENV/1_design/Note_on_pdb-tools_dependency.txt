- In this case of DENV, you need to change the name of histidines from HIS to HIP and reverse every cycle. 
- Rosetta will understand HIP as a protonated histidine in the structural optmization.
- ProteinMPNN need to have HIS as histidine 3-letter code, that's why we need to go back every cycle.

- The "design_acid.sh" script is dependent on the "pdb_rplresname.py" script to make these residue name changes. The Python script is available as part of pdb-tools and it need to be in the current directory.
