Rosetta doesn't easily allow protonated histidine, because of that I used this method to allow it:

1-copy HIS_P.params (protonated HIS parameters) from data base to current directory:

cp rosetta_3.13/main/database/chemical/residue_type_sets/fa_standard/residue_types/protonation_states/HIS_P.params .

2-modify HIS_P.params according:

NAME HIS_P --> NAME HIP

comment VARIANT PROTONATED

IO_STRING HIS H --> IO_STRING HIP H

comment AA HIS

PROPERTIES PROTEIN CANONICAL_AA ALPHA_AA L_AA POLAR METALBINDING CHARGED POSITIVE_CHARGE --> PROPERTIES PROTEIN CANONICAL_AA ALPHA_AA L_AA POLAR SC_ORBITALS METALBINDING CYCLIC CHARGED POSITIVE_CHARGE

3- Rename HIS residues in your pdb to HIP, I like to use pdb-tools (http://www.bonvinlab.org/pdb-tools/):

pdb_rplresname -HIS:HIP <file.pdb> > <file_temp.pdb>
mv file_temp.pdb file.pdb

4- use flag -extra_res_fa HIS_P.params on your protocols 

5- profit (remember to rename back to HIS if other softwares are used)
