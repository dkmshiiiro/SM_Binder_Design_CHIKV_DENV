- A version of Rosetta compliled with 5hfd was need to compute the fragment quality metrics (worst9mer and worst9mer_helix).



- You will also need a database called "ss_grouped_vall_all.h5" available at:

files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/modular_repeat_protein_2020/ss_grouped_vall_all.h5



- A detailed explanation of the Mover is available at:
